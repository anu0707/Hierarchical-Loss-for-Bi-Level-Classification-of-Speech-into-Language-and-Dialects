This is an official code for the ICASSP paper, Hierarchical loss for bi-level classification of speech into language and dialects.
There are 3 different methods that have been proposed to solve the problem of dialect identification. 
- train_CCE is the code for training the x-vector based model for End-to-end training using CCE loss.
- test_CCE is the code for testing the x-vector based model for testing the model trained using CCE loss (second approach).
- train_hierarchloss is the code for training the x-vector based model using novel Hierarchical loss. (third approach).
- test_hierarchloss is the code for testing the x-vector based model trained using novel hierarchical loss.
